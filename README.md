###There are a few trends between work-type and stroke chances. Government jobs seem to put you at the most risk of stroke, especially as you age, second to that is prvate following the same trend. The third is self-employment with a few exceptions correlating with age, followed by the very rare stroke that occurs in children.

###Since these plots exclude a few of the main columns, the most noticeable pattern is between age and chances of stroke, which overwhelmingly show that as you age your chances of stroke grow.

##Conclusion
I plan to use the the chosen data set to predict the likeliehood of certain people to have a stroke. I will do this through comparing each of the different factors to find patterns of correlation. So far, it seems men are more at risk after mariage while women are slightly more at risk before. Also higher-stress type jobs seem to put you at higher risk for stroke, and as age increases your stroke chances climb as-well.
